      <h3> COMMIT TO BE BEST IN PROGRAMMING .</h3>
      <p>
      "First, solve the problem. Then, 
      write the code" Learning to program
       means learning how to solve problems
        using code. Conceptually it is not very
         difficult to write a program that solves 
         a problem that you can solve yourself. The 
         skill you need to acquire is thinking very
          precisely about how you solve the problem 
          and breaking it down into steps that are so
           simple that a computer can execute them.
